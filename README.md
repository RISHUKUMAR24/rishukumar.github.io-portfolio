# Portfolio (static)

This is a small static portfolio site (index.html + style.css).  
Download and customize `index.html` to replace your name, links and text.

Files:
- index.html — main page
- style.css — styles

How to publish:
1. Create a GitHub repository (public).
2. Upload these files to the repository root (or push with git).
3. Enable GitHub Pages in the repo Settings → Pages → Deploy from branch `main` (root).
4. Visit the published URL (it may take a few minutes to become active).

If you want the site at the root URL `https://yourusername.github.io`, name the repository `yourusername.github.io` (exactly).
